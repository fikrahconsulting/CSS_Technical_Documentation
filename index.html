                <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
                </p>

                        &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;

                <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>

                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
                    <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                    <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
                <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
                
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <div>
                    <code>
                        body {
                            background-color: lightblue;
                          }
                          
                          h1 {
                            color: white;
                            text-align: center;
                          }
                          
                          p {
                            font-family: verdana;
                            font-size: 20px;
                          }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <h4>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h4>

                <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
                </p>

                <p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
                
                <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>

                <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

                <h4>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h4>

                <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
                <p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
